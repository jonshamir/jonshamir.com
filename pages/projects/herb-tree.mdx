An online index of culinary herbs, created as the final project for my Visual Communication degree. The plants are organized according to their scientific classification, creating a herbal “tree of life”. Each herb contains a description as well as information about using it in the kitchen. In addition to research, design and development, I photographed dozens of plant specimens from the HUJI Herbarium, which are incorporated into the project.
