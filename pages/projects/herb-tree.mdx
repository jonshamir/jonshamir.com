An online index of culinary herbs, created as the final project for my Visual
Communication degree. The plants are organized according to their scientific
classification, creating a herbal “tree of life”. Each herb contains a
description as well as information about using it in the kitchen. In addition to
research, design and development, I photographed dozens of plant specimens from
the HUJI Herbarium, which are incorporated into the project.

The site is currently offline but will be available soon!
