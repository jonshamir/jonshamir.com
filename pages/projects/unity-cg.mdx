In 2019 I was given the opportunity to rebuild the practical side of the
Computer Graphics Course at the Hebrew University from the ground up. The goal
was to teach Computer Graphics in a more engaging way, using the real-time
interactivity of the Unity game engine.

Due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, the class had to be taught remotely. In
an attempt to improve the learning experience for the students, I created 12
lectures with over 500 slides including custom illustrations & animations that
visualize different concepts.

I also created 5 coding exercises involving subjects such as Subdivision
Surfaces, Ray-Tracing, Shading, Texturing and more. I taught the students
remotely and graded their assignments.

## Tools Used

- Unity3D + C#
- HLSL (shaders)
- Adobe CC
