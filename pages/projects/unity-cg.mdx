In 2019 I was given the opportunity to rebuild the practical side of the
Computer Graphics Course at the Hebrew University from the ground up. The goal
was to teach Computer Graphics in a more engaging way, using the real-time
interactivity of the Unity game engine.

Due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, the class had to be taught remotely. In
an attempt to improve the learning experience for the students, I created 12
lectures with over 500 slides including custom illustrations & animations that
visualize different concepts.

<figure>
  <Slider Infinite={true} speed={500}>
    {[...Array(9).keys()].map((i) => (
      <div key={i}>
        <img
          src={`/projects/unity-cg/slide${i + 1}.png`}
          alt={`Unity CG Slide ${i + 1}`}
          style={{ width: "100%" }}
        />
      </div>
    ))}
  </Slider>

I also created 5 coding exercises involving subjects such as Subdivision
Surfaces, Ray-Tracing, Shading, Texturing and more. I taught the students
remotely and graded their assignments.
