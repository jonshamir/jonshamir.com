title: Leaf Map
description: Interactive map of leaf shapes
---

I used machine learning techniques to organize tree species according to their leaf shape. The idea was to create a more intuitive and friendly way to recognize plant species.

Leaf Features
Using the Shape Context Algorithm I generated a "fingerprint" vector representing each leaf, which is then used to asses the similarity of shapes. Finally the dimension of this vector is reduced to 2D using PCA and t-SNE, and the leaves are displayed in an interactive interface I created using D3.js.

The project was inspired by this Font Map, all data and images were taken from the Leaf Snap dataset.

## Tools Used

- JavaScript (interface)
- Python (data proccessing)
