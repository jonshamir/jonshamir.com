I used machine learning techniques to organize tree species according to their
leaf shape. The idea was to create a more intuitive and friendly way to
recognize plant species.

Using the [Shape Context Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_context)
I generated a "fingerprint" vector representing each leaf, which is then used to
asses the similarity of shapes. Finally the dimension of this vector is reduced
to 2D using PCA and
[t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding),
and the leaves are displayed in an interactive interface I created using D3.js.

The project was inspired by the
[IDEO Font Map](https://www.designboom.com/design/ideo-font-map-interview-typography-04-21-2017/),
all data and images were taken from the
[Leaf Snap dataset](https://leafsnap.com/dataset/).

## Tools Used

- JavaScript (interface)
- Python (data proccessing)
