      <p>
        Spacetop is a spatial operating system, designed to work with a
        keyboard, mouse and augmented reality glasses as a display. Unlike other
        XR products, Spacetop has a minimal learning curve and is intuitive to
        first-time users because it builds upon traditional desktop interaction
        paradigms.

      <p>
        Translating the traditional desktop user interface to a 3D environment
        provided many challenges, both in design and implementation. My work
        involved prototyping novel spatial interactions, defining and developing
        frameworks to manage UI in 3D space, creating special shader effects and
        more.

      <h2>The Canvas</h2>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/projects/spacetop/cursor-move.gif"
          alt="The cursor moving around on the canvas"
          style={{
            maxHeight: "200px",
            float: "inline-end",
            margin: "0 1rem",
            borderRadius: "var(--rounding-small)"
          }}
        />
        The canvas is a huge virtual &quot;screen&quot; that curves around the
        user. Instead of being limited by the edges of a physical screen, the
        virtual canvas can expand to fit the content. To allow the users to
        understand the 3D shape of the canvas surface without being
        claustrophobic, a dot grid is revealed only around the cursor and
        content.
      </p>
      <p>
        The canvas itself can be panned and manipulated using touchpad gestures
        or keyboard shortcuts.
      </p>

          style={{ maxHeight: "500px", height: "auto", maxWidth: "1000px" }}

      <p>
        What does it mean for a dialog or notification to exist in a 3D space?
        The spatial nature of the platform, along with the limited field of
        view, required some creative solutions, such a the compass component
        that guides your attention when it is needed somewhere you can&apos;t
        see.

          width={1000}
          height={450}
        />

      <h2>Materials & Rendering</h2>
      <p>
        Rendering spatial interfaces opens up interesting possibilities and
        effects. Subtle highlights can react to the movement of the head to give
        the illusion of depth. Soft shadows can indicate distance between
        objects.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <Image
          src="/projects/spacetop/bevel.gif"
          alt="A special shader that created a 3D illusion"
          style={{ maxHeight: "450px", height: "auto", maxWidth: "1000px" }}
          width={1000}
          height={450}
        />
      </figure>
      <p>
        To remain performant, all UI rendering is based on quads, however in the
        fragment shader we can create special effects. In XR we know the
        position of the head. Using Parallax mapping and normal mapping a 3D
        illusion can be achieved.
