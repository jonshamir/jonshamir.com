        I&apos;ve always been fascinated by the shapes of plants. While studying
        Dimensionality Reduction and data visualization techniques, I applied
        these concepts to categorize tree species based on leaf shapes. My goal
        was to develop a more intuitive and user-friendly approach to plant
        species identification.

          style={{ maxHeight: "300px", height: "auto", maxWidth: "1000px" }}

        Using the{" "}
        <Outlink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_context">
          Shape Context Algorithm
        </Outlink>{" "}
        I generated a &quot;fingerprint&quot; vector representing each leaf. The
        vectors of similarly shaped leaves lie closer to each other in
        n-dimensional space. To display a 2D map of the leaves I reduced the
        dimensionality using a combination of PCA and{" "}

          t-SNE
        </Outlink>
        .

        Finally the leaves are displayed on an interactive canvas I created
        using D3.js. The project was inspired by the{" "}

        , all data and images were taken from the{" "}
