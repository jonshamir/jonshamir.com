# Thoughts on a Button

I saw a group of geometric portraits by [Walter Dexel](https://www.walter-dexel.com/) at the museum recently. Looking closer at one of them, something jumped at me:

<figure>
  <Image
    src={dexelImg}
    alt="Painting by Walter Dexel showing a figure with an X-shaped button on their shirt"
    style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
  />
  <figcaption>Walter Dexel, 1933</figcaption>
</figure>

Can you see it? the shape on the striped shirt "feels" interactive - it's a close button!

I think most people today will first parse this as a "close button" and not a "clothing button". It's interesting to think that when the painting was created in 1933, the "default" parsing was surely a regular button, but seeing this today it feels so modern and familiar.

This also caused me to wonder where the UI element's name "button" may have originated - obviously, machines have physical _buttons_ as well, but are they linguistically related to clothing buttons?

Well, not directly according to this site. But they share a common ancestor - the french _bouton_, meaning bud or protruding knob or something that sticks out.

That's it, just thought it was interesting.
