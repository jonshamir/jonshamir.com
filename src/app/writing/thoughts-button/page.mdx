# Thoughts on a Button

I saw this painting by [Walter Dexel](https://www.walter-dexel.com/) at the museum and immediately something jumped at me:

I'm pretty sure you can see it too - the shape on the shirt "feels" interactive - it's a close button!

I think almost every person in the world today will first parse this as a "close button" and not a "clothes button"
It's interesting to me that when the painting was draw, only X years ago, the "default" parsing was surly a regular button

This also caused me to wonder where the UI element's name "button" may have originated - obviously machines have physical buttons but is that related to the clothes buttons?

Well, not directly according to this site. But they share a common ancestor - the french baton meaning bud or protruding knob.
That's it, thought it was interesting.
