# Animated dark mode with CSS

How to implement dark mode in a static Next.js site with some bells and wistles

Part of the fun of working on a personal website is to spend unnecessary amounts of time on small details. I wanted to find a unique way to implement the obligatory dark / light mode. You can check out the final result by clicking the small icon in the upper-left hand corner. The colors should quickly crossfade, while the icon itself does a little spherical animation to invert its colors, inspired by [the moon](link).

## Dark mode with CSS variables

The basic idea is quite simple - using CSS variables I define my color palette of the site. The dark version of these colors is overriden when the document gets the the `.dark` class:

```
  :root {
    --foreground-color: #ddd;
    --background-color: #111;
  }
  &.dark {
    --foreground-color: #111;
    --background-color: #ddd;
  }

  body {
    background-color: var(--background-color);
    color: var(--foreground-color);
  }
```

When adding and removing the `.dark` class, the browser automatically updates all the elements using the variable:

To get a nice transition between the modes, I like to define a `--transition-defaults` and wherever I use one of the theme colors, I add a corresponding transition. Using the defaults variable ensures the colors all change in the same timing

```
  :root {
    ...
    --transition-defaults: 150ms ease-out;
  }
  body {
    transition:
      background-color var(--transition-defaults),
      color var(--transition-defaults);
  }
```

This site is a statically generated using next.js generated blog. I will overview the implementation here, but if you are interested in the details of how dark mode is implemented, I highly reccommend Josh Comeau's [ Quest for the Perfect Dark Mode](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/), and I go into more details at the end.

Also inspired by:

- Inline script tag - the key was to use \<script\> instead of nextjs \<Script\>, and put it in the head instead of the beginning of the body
- useColorScheme Hook
- ColorSchemeToggle component

## Animated transition

there are all kinds of cool effects to transition from dark to light, but I decided to go with a simple crossfade.

[Link to some cool examples]

To implement this, I created CSS variables for colors in light and dark mode.
I also have a variable for the transition settings

For this website I wanted to create a nice theme toggle.

I originally created a CSS animation to represent the phases of the moon a long time ago. A while bac
In this post I'm going to break down the creation of the dark mode toggle in this website, which has sort of a 3D effect to it, inspired by the moon. you can try it out here:

So how does it work?
The idea is to have 2 halves
There is a hidden circle in the middle with scaleX(0), with each half being one color
On animating, the hidden inner circle is animated to a scale of scaleX(1), then the two halves are flipped, then the scale is animated back to scaleX(0)

## The Setup

HTML button element

```html
<button class="ThemeToggle">
  <span class="ThemeToggle__half ThemeToggle__half--left"></span>
  <span class="ThemeToggle__half ThemeToggle__half--right"></span>
</button>
```

CSS

```css
.ThemeToggle {
  --size: 60px;
  --border-width: 2px;
  --foreground-color: #ccc;
  --background-color: #222;
}
```

## The Animation

The animation is split into 4 parts:

1. The initial state
2. The first half of the animation
3. The second half of the animation
4. The final state

## Final touches - the gap

The gap is created by the border-width and the size of the button.
