# Animated Dark Mode Transition with Modern CSS

In this post I will explain how to implement a smooth transition between light and dark mode, using CSS `@property`. I also show how to create an icon that smoothly animates between the modes with a little spherical animation. You can see the effect by clicking the small icon in the top-right corner, or in this small demo sandbox:

<ColorModeToggleDemo showToggle isAnimated>
  Click the button to toggle modes:
</ColorModeToggleDemo>

I will be focusing on the CSS implementation of the effect. The logic itself in React is mostly based on Josh Comeau's [Quest for the Perfect Dark Mode](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/) with some extra help from [Matt Stobbs's post](https://www.mattstobbs.com/elderjs-dark-mode/). You are also welcome to take a look at the source code of this site.

## Setup - Defining the Color Palette & Toggle

The basic idea is simple - we define a color palette using CSS variables (a.k.a. [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties)), then override their values with dark colors under the `.dark` class selector:

```css
:root {
  --foreground-color: #ddd;
  --background-color: #111;

  color: var(--foreground-color);
  background-color: var(--background-color);
}

:root.dark {
  --foreground-color: #111;
  --background-color: #ddd;
}
```

We'll also add a simple button to switch the color mode - when a user clicks the button, we toggle the `dark` class on the root element using JavaScript:

```js
// This is called when the button is clicked
function toggleDarkMode() {
  const root = document.documentElement;
  const isDark = root.classList.contains("dark");

  if (isDark) {
    root.classList.remove("dark");
  } else {
    root.classList.add("dark");
  }
}
```

<ColorModeToggleDemo isAnimated={false}>
  Click to toggle dark class:
</ColorModeToggleDemo>

With the magic of CSS variables, the browser automatically updates all elements that use the colors we defined! In this case, the text and background colors change, as well as the button itself.

## Animating the Transition

To get a nice animation between the color modes, we can declare a CSS transition for any property that uses our colors - in this case, `color` and `background-color`. In order to keep the timing consistent, I like to define and reuse a `--transition-timing` variable:

```css
:root {
  /* ... */
  --transition-timing: 400ms ease-out;

  transition:
    background-color var(--transition-timing),
    color var(--transition-timing);
}
```

<ColorModeToggleDemo isAnimated={true}>
  Click to toggle dark class:
</ColorModeToggleDemo>

We did it - The text and background colors cross-fade nicely!

But alas - our button still flashes immediately to the new colors. This is because we have a nice hover effect on the button that uses `transition: opacity` which overrides the `transition` we declared on our `:root`.

```css
button {
  /* ... */
  color: var(--background-color);
  background-color: var(--foreground-color);
  opacity: 0.5;

  /* Overrides transition of color & background-color :( */
  transition: opacity var(--transition-timing);
}

button:hover {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

We can solve it naively by defining a `transition` of all the properties together:

```css
button {
  transition:
    opacity var(--transition-timing),
    background-color var(--transition-timing),
    color var(--transition-timing);
}
```

However, this can become cumbersome very quickly and easy to forget. If we miss a single element it suddenly sticks out unnaturally when switching modes.

_Find the offending element_

Thankfully, there is a new CSS _at-rule_ that makes this much simpler.

## Using @property

What if instead of transitioning the CSS properties that use the colors, we could transition the _color variables themselves_? This is now possible thanks to `@property` rules!

> The `@property` CSS at-rule is part of the CSS Houdini set of APIs. It allows developers to explicitly define CSS custom properties, allowing for property type checking and constraining, setting default values, and defining whether a custom property can inherit values or not.

[@property on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@property)

Crucially for us, it allows us to _transition_ the css variables themselves! we define our colors inside `@property` blocks with `syntax: "<color>"`:

```css
@property --foreground-color {
  syntax: "<color>";
  inherits: true;
  initial-value: #ddd;
}

@property --background-color {
  syntax: "<color>";
  inherits: true;
  initial-value: #111;
}
```

We then define their values as we did before, with the dark versions as well, but we declare a transition on the variables themselves rather than on specific properties that use them:

```css
:root {
  --foreground-color: #ddd;
  --background-color: #111;

  color: var(--foreground-color);
  background-color: var(--background-color);

  transition:
    --foreground-color var(--transition-timing),
    --background-color var(--transition-timing);
}

:root.dark {
  --foreground-color: #111;
  --background-color: #ddd;
}
```

The result is a smooth transition wherever the variable is used, without having to think twice when using `transition`.

</ColorModeToggleDemo>

## Creating the Fancy Toggle

different toggles:

- Sun / moon
- Half circle
- Apple thing

The nice thing is that it sort of behaves like a toggle - with the white part moving from side to side
while the icon itself stays the same shape in negative

The idea is to have 2 halves
There is a hidden circle in the middle with scaleX(0), with each half being one color
On animating, the hidden inner circle is animated to a scale of scaleX(1), then the two halves are flipped, then the scale is animated back to scaleX(0)

### The Setup

HTML button element

```html
<button class="ThemeToggle">
  <span class="ThemeToggle__half ThemeToggle__half--left"></span>
  <span class="ThemeToggle__half ThemeToggle__half--right"></span>
</button>
```

CSS

```css
.ThemeToggle {
  --size: 60px;
  --border-width: 2px;
}
```

### Animating the toggle

The animation is split into 4 parts:

1. The initial state
2. The first half of the animation
3. The second half of the animation
4. The final state

## Naming - Theme, Scheme or Mode?

First things first - how do I name this feature?

I believe naming things is very important, especially in code. When writing this post I decided to get to the bottom of this!

I found 3 commonly used terms - **Color Theme**, **Color Scheme** and **Color Mode**, as well as some less common options such as _Brightness_ in Flutter or _UIUserInterfaceStyle_ (ahem, UIKit). I'll focus on the 3 prevalent options:

### Color Theme

A theme can be defined as _A recurring idea; a motif_ - in the context of UI design, it is [usually](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(computing)>) refers to a "package" that contains fonts, colors, shapes and more.
I feel that colors are _part_ of a UI theme, so the term "Color Theme" doesn't feel right to me.

VS Code:
`"workbench.colorTheme": "Dark+ (default dark)"`

Material UI (MUI)
“palette mode” (light/dark) e.g. `theme.palette.mode='dark'`

Jetpack Compose (Android)
“light theme” / “dark theme” (Material 3 ColorScheme); use `isSystemInDarkTheme()` to pick light/dark

### Color Scheme

[Color Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_scheme)

A color scheme, from my understanding, is synonymous with a "color palette" - a set of colors designed to work well together. In this case, you could consider the light and dark colors to be a "scheme", or part of the overall "color scheme"
Scheme - _An orderly combination of related parts._

Rooted in design theory (“monochromatic scheme”, “analogous scheme”).

CSS uses `prefers-color-scheme: light | dark`

iOS / SwiftUI:
`ColorScheme.light`, `ColorScheme.dark`

### Color Mode

[Mode (User Interface)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(user_interface)>)

Meaning: Almost always refers to a binary or categorical setting (e.g., “Light mode” vs “Dark mode”). Less about aesthetics, more about state or preference.

Android:
Uses `UiModeManager` (`MODE_NIGHT_YES`, `MODE_NIGHT_NO`) and XML attribute android:theme.

Material UI (MUI):
`palette.mode = 'light' | 'dark'`

Chakra UI:
`colorMode = 'light' | 'dark'` and `useColorMode()` hook.

Tailwind CSS:
Uses `dark:` prefix (no explicit variable).
Config has `darkMode: 'media' | 'class'`.
