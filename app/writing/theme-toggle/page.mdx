# Animated dark mode toggle with CSS

Ive wanted to get into technincal blogging for a long time but always found myself getting lost in the details, working on illustrations and interactive examples and getting lost in the process.
So I decided to start with something relatively straightforward - how I made the little dark mode toggle on the corner of this website

I originally created a CSS animation to represent the phases of the moon a long time ago. A while bac
In this post I'm going to break down the creation of the dark mode toggle in this website, which has sort of a 3D effect to it, inspired by the moon. you can try it out here:

So how does it work?
The idea is to have 2 halves
There is a hidden circle in the middle with scaleX(0), with each half being one color
On animating, the hidden inner circle is animated to a scale of scaleX(1), then the two halves are flipped, then the scale is animated back to scaleX(0)
