        I used machine learning techniques to organize tree species according to
        their leaf shape. The idea was to create a more intuitive and friendly
        way to recognize plant species.{" "}

        Using the{" "}
        <Outlink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_context">
          Shape Context Algorithm
        </Outlink>{" "}
        I generated a &quot;fingerprint&quot; vector representing each leaf,
        which is then used to asses the similarity of shapes. Finally the
        dimension of this vector is reduced to 2D using PCA and{" "}

        , and the leaves are displayed in an interactive interface I created
        using D3.js.
