        Spacetop is a spatial operating system, designed to work with a
        keyboard, mouse and augmented reality glasses as a display. Unlike other
        XR products, Spacetop has a minimal learning curve and is intuitive to
        first-time users because it builds upon traditional desktop interaction
        paradigms.

      <p>
        Translating the traditional desktop user interface to a 3D environment
        provided many challenges, both in design and implementation. My work
        involved prototyping novel spatial interactions, defining and developing
        frameworks to manage UI in 3D space, creating special shader effects and
        more.

      <h2>The Canvas</h2>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/projects/spacetop/cursor-move.gif"
          alt="The cursor moving around on the canvas"
          style={{
            maxHeight: "200px",
            float: "inline-end",
            margin: "1rem",
            borderRadius: "var(--rounding-small)"
          }}
        />
        The canvas is a huge virtual &quot;screen&quot; that curves around the
        user. Instead of being limited by the edges of a physical screen, the
        virtual canvas can expand to fit the content. To allow the users to
        understand the 3D shape of the canvas surface without being
        claustrophobic, a dot grid is revealed only around the cursor and
        content.
      </p>
      <p>The canvas itself can be panned and zoomed by the user.</p>

      <h2>Spaces</h2>
      <p>
        What does it mean for a dialog or pop-up to be in 3D space? How can we
        ensure the user understands what's going on without losing context or
        missing a notification? The system UI structure, its layers, their roles
        and mechanics: how dialogs work, where do notifications pop up, how is
        input focus communicated, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Created a framework for managing user interfaces in 3D, integrating data
        from various sensors into a performant and easy to use API. Worked
        closely with the algorithms team to incorporate computer vision models
        into the product.

      <h2>Materials & Rendering</h2>
      <p>
        Developed custom shaders designed for XR rendering, taking into account
        performance and legibility while implementing spatial UI effects unique
        to the 3D medium. 3D user interfaces allow us to utilize material
        properties that we do not have in 2d interfaces.
