Usually, textures are mapped to 3D meshes using _explicit UV mapping_ - each vertex is assigned specific UV (texture-space) coordinates. However, UV coordinates can also be calculated procedurally from vertex positions.

**Projection mapping** is a texture mapping technique that calculates UV coordinates dynamically by mapping between the texture and some intermediate surface, then projecting this surface onto a 3D object.

In the case of spherical projection mapping, we map each vertex to a point on a sphere, ignoring the radius. Given cartesian coordinates $$(x,y,z)$$ of a vertex we want to find its spherical coordinates $$(r,\theta,\phi)$$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\
    \theta &= \arctan2(y, x) \\
    \phi &= \arccos(y / r)
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
{/* u = 0.5 + \frac{\theta}{2\pi}, \quad v = 1 - \frac{\phi}{\pi} */}
$$

You might notice a little seam on one side of the Earth. This is due to the way the uv coordinates are calculated.
